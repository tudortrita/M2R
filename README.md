# M2R - The Distribution of the Extreme from a Normal Sample

M2R Group Project (2017-2018), Imperial College London

### Abstract:

In this project, we look at the properties of maxima arising from normal random samples. We
will find that asymptotically, there are only three types of distribution (Gumbel, Frechet and
Weibull) that describe the data and these can be combined into one; the Generalised Extreme
Value (GEV) distribution. We will begin by proving this result, known as the Fisher-Tippett
Theorem, and then we present methods (MoM, MLE, PWM) for estimating the parameters of the
Gumbel distribution and GEV distribution. We then look at Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plots and
Bootstrapping techniques, which find the model with the best t.

The project then focuses on analysing earthquake data from Greece to be able to derive statistical
properties and make future predictions. We do this by fitting a Gumbel distribution and GEV
distribution to the Greece earthquake data, and estimating parameters for each model using the
methods above. We then use QQ plots and Bootstrap Confidence Intervals to find the model
that fits the Greek earthquake data the most. Finally, we look at return periods which will give
predictions as to when to expect the next earthquake of a given magnitude.
